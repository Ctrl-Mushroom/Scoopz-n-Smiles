			Our inherent love for the gelato brought us to Philippines, where we studied at the prestigious Gelato Scoops University. We soon realized that the only way to bring the authentic gelato experience to the Philippines is to recreate the old-world handcrafted gelato making techniques. We came back here with everything that we have learned and combined it with our passion for authentic Italian-style gelato.

			Scoopz n' Smiles made its debut in December 2018 when the first store located in Creamy Road Pie introduced the then relatively unknown flavor of Speculaas (cookie butter). This set off a year-long trend of Speculaas in the food scene. With inventive flavors such as Lemon Basil, Cereal and Milk, Summer Lavender, Chocolate Peperoncino, Mango Sake, Blueberry & Goat Cheese, Strawberries & Prosecco and especially the Taho among others, Scoopz n' Smiles raised the bar for the gelato and ice cream industry and established its position as Manila’s top gelateria.

				It is our goal to give customers the best gelato made in the Pinoy way. This means we only use fresh, all-natural, and premium-quality ingredients in every scoop. We find the best ingredients to create each small-batch of gelato combining old-world methods learned from gelato masters with the state-of-the-art.

				We source our ingredients fresh, locally, when we can - we search the globe to find the finest ingredients for our gelato - whether its vanilla beans from Madagascar, chocolate from Belgium, local fresh milk, farm-fresh eggs, blueberries, strawberries and pistachios from California or mangoes and coffee from our own Philippine growers. Our Gelato is made with all-natural ingredients that are fresh-churned daily and hand-crafted in small batches.

				In keeping with our commitment to bring you the best possible gelato experience, we store our gelato in Pozzetto cabinets to ensure the least amount of air & light contamination while maintaining a constant temperature. Then our gelato melts faster, because it is all natural with NO artificial flavorings or preservatives. This means that you will have to enjoy each scoop faster, and come back for more. And it takes time to make because we prepare small batches daily using the slow-churning method of Cattabriga Effe mixers, the mark and standard of authentic Italian gelato. Each batch is made no more than 12 to 20 hours prior to your enjoyment.
